        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
             These chicken thighs are cooked in one skillet for easy cleanup.
             Carrots, potatoes, and onions are added for a complete meal.
             Serve with a side salad and some crusty bread.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound bone-in chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons paprika</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>½ pound baby potatoes, halved</li>
            <li>½ onion, sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken broth, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                 Season chicken thighs with paprika, salt, and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                 Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken thighs skin-side down 
                 in the skillet and cook, without moving, until golden brown, 7 to 9 minutes. Flip
                 thighs over and cook for an additional 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the skillet 
                 and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                 Add potatoes, cut side down, and cook over medium-high heat until golden
                 brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add carrots and onions and cook until onions are soft
                 and translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in 3/4 cup chicken broth, scraping up all
                 the browned bits.
            </li>
            <li>
                 Dissolve corn starch in 1/4 cup chicken broth and pour into the skillet. Stir until
                 well combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                 Place chicken thighs over vegetables, cover, and cook until carrots are tender
                 and chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 25 to 30
                 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165
                 degrees F (74 degrees C). Season with additional salt and pepper if needed.

        </ol>
